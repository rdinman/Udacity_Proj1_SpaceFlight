# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was curious about space flight launch successes to ask: 
    1: Has success rate improved through time?
    2: What companies have the highest success rates?
    3: Do companies that spend more have higher success rates?
    4: Does launch success improve with experience?

# File Descriptions
There is a data file [datasets_828921_1417131_Space_Corrected.csv] obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957. 
There is a notbook availible here to showcase work related to the above questions. 
There is a folder 'Misc_files' that contains images used in Medium.com blog post, as well as a .py file used for data analyses.

# How to Interact with this Project
This project was created for a Udacity Data Science course and is intended to showcase some very simple python data manipulation and data analysis. Please look at the blog, notbook and .py file for details, or read the blog post on medium.com here:
