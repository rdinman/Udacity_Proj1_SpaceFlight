# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was curious about space flight launch successes to ask: 
    1: Which company has the highest success rate over the past ~ 50 years?
    2: Have success rates improved through time?
    3: Has the day of the week or the week of the year of launch changed over the past ~ 50 years?
    4: Does launch success improve with experience?

# File Descriptions
There is a data file [datasets_828921_1417131_Space_Corrected.csv] obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957. 
There is a notbook availible here to showcase work related to the above questions. 
There is an additional .py file that contains all code including model specification. 

# How to interact with this project
This project was created for a Udacity Data Science course and is intended to showcase some very simple python data manipulation and data analysis. Please look at the blog, notbook and .py file.
